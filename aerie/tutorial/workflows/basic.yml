        The control palette on the top-left of the canvas has various workflow-wide actions.

        Try dragging it around to move it. (It's not resizable, though)

        You can use it to create, switch, etc. workflows.

        The editing/frozen toggle controls whether changes can be made.

        This only exists during the workflow run.

        It will run independently of the Start/Finish path.

        More on "Finish" later.

        Ignore it for now.

        This will be emitted as a separate output "hello".

        How outputs are saved depends on what runs the workflow.

        In the UI, outputs appear in a tab at the bottom-right of the window.

        Outputs are not saved automatically. You will have to use the save dialog for each output you want to keep.

        Tabs can be moved around, docked and resized at will.

        Try dragging the Logs tab to one side of this pane.

        (Note: The Logs tab only shows LLM request/response logs. Messages generated by the UI are only visible on the terminal, when enabled).

        You can import more workflows from the control palette.

        Try importing other examples and looking through them. They should be arranged alphabetically roughly by increasing complexity.
