# Agents

- Language model with tools and context
- Memory can be provided as a tool
- In chat-driven paradigm, model must decide when to use tools
  - Must select from all available tools at a time
  - Limited context window on smaller models can cause confusion
- Workflow paradigm allows us to restrict tools and process results
- Can orchestrate multiple agents on subtasks
